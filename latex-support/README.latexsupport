LaTeX Support implements an LaTeX-IDE for Vim/gVim. It has been written to
considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by
inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets.    There
are many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing LaTeX. Please read the documentation.  This plugin can be used with Vim
version 7.x.

  INSTALLATION
=======================================================================================

The subdirectories in the zip archive  latex-support.zip  mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/.vim/
for LINUX/UNIX ($VIM/vimfiles/ for Windows; find the value of $VIM with 
":echo $VIM" from inside Vim).

(0) Save the template files in '$HOME/.vim/latex-support/templates' if
    you have changed any of them.

(1) Copy the zip archive  latex-support.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip latex-support.zip

(2) Loading of plugin files must be enabled. If not use
      :filetype plugin on
    This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. Create one if there
    is none. 

(3) Set at least some personal details into latex-support/templates/Templates 
    by overriding the defaults.
    Please read the documentation to fully understand the template system.

    The files customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or 
    extensions for your .vimrc and .gvimrc ( _vimrc and _gvimrc under Windows).
    You may want to use parts of them. The files are documented. 

(4) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/.vimrc'.
    The files customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or 
    extensions for your .vimrc and .gvimrc ( _vimrc and _gvimrc under Windows).
    You may want to use parts of them. The files are documented. 

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and macros
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  using additional plugins
